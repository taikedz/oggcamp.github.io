Dear OggCampers,

Given the current COVID-19 situation, and no firm knowledge of how isolation policies will play out, it is with regret that
I must announce that the intended OggCamp 2020 is cancelled - the open source whisky schenanigans in Scotland will have to
wait!

We are still trying to figure out our options as to what can be done with this year, so de feel free to look out for
announcements on our [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAAsF-xo4ol9jAjNW8A) or
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/4DcDk6Y)

Stay safe everyone!

Tai
