Why are there speakers if it's an unconference?

It's a good question! We like to pin down some talks to get the ball rolling, these are in a single scheduled track, leaving the rest of the time open for ... whatever you come up with! Here are some of the talks for 2019:

## Noobs on Ubs

I started out as a total noob using Ubuntu, copying and pasting from stack overflow in wild abandon to install whatever I needed without a care in the world. A few chmod 777s later - I actually learnt what that does (spoilers - it’s not always the answer) and decided I should maybe learn how my OS works.

In this talk, I’ll be explaining how Linux works and sharing my story as a beginner.

This talk is for you if you’re a beginner/hobbyist/Linux-lite user and looking to feel less alone in the world.

Software Engineer, likes making and breaking stuff, hanging out in the tech community, organiser of @WiT_Notts, Free and Open Source advocate. She/her

## The state of MQTT

Back in 2009, at OggCamp01 (before we got the numbering convention sorted out), I gave the opening keynote about Internet of Things and the MQTT messaging protocol that underpins all the cool things I’d been doing to automate my home, save energy in a number of ways, and make the Isle of Wight ferries tweet about their movements. Roger Light was in the audience and was sufficiently inspired by my talk to rush home and create the mosquitto project on launchpad. The rest, as they say, is history, and 10 years later, at OggCamp19, I will give edited highlights of the tremendous impact  MQTT has made in the world of Internet of Things in the last ten years, which has been considerably helped by the widespread adoption of mosquitto as the first open source MQTT message broker. I will also talk about some of my recent IoT projects, including animatronic dinosaurs, more ferry-related stuff, and keeping antelopes warm in their beds in the winter!

## Stopping Brexit with Data Science

Remain Voter is an independent grassroots group aiming to make every Remain vote count.

Remain Voter was launched in May 2019 to identify the best tactical voting options for Remainers in the European Elections. With £500 and three weeks, remainvoter.com got into the top 10,000 websites in the UK and was published in the Huffington Post, ITV, Mail Online, the Mirror and AOL.

I’ll talk about how our group of open source advocates, data scientists and techies got together, the model behind the tactical voting engine, and how you can help stop Brexit.

## Video Killed My Data Plan: Delivering video that doesn't break the bank

Video is one of the fastest growing mediums on the web and in mobile applications. Video files have been shown to increase engagement, and can be a great way to deliver your message quickly. (And who doesn’t love animated GIFs?)

However, video that takes a long time to start up leads to frustration and abandonment. The same goes for video that stalls during playback. In this talk, you’ll learn best practices to optimize the delivery of your video to you customers, ensuring fast delivery and minimizing stalls for a great customer experience.

## The IndieWeb Movement: Owning Your Data and Being the Change You Want to See in the Web

In today’s age of the Web, we’ve resigned ourselves to using social Silos, such as Twitter, Facebook or Medium. Content we create on their platforms is owned by them, free for them to profit off it, and we can’t move off the platforms because then all our followers would need to use a new platform.

The IndieWeb is all about taking the control of where we post, and how. As citizens of the Web we deserve to own the content and data we so lovingly produce, so why don’t we do it? Why don’t we use our websites as our social hub, publishing on our own site, and then syndicating everywhere else?

If there’s something that you want a Silo to do, why not build it yourself? If we build our own platforms, we can decide how they work and interoperate. By selfdogfooding we can use our own projects to help drive the functionality we want, being the change we want to see in the world.

We’ll talk about the underlying open standards and Open Source components that are driving the ease of adoption across it, such as Microformats2, Webmention, Micropub and Microsub, and IndieAuth, to name but a few!

This is truly about creating the Social Web, providing an RSS-feed like experience to follow all your friends, colleagues, and people of interest, but being able to interact in-feed, as you would on i.e. Twitter. You can add inline comments, like, or reshare the content for those following your own site.

And of course, it’s all about enabling everyone to get involved - feedback from not-as-technical folks, through to multiple implementations of the same tools are actively encouraged.

But don’t even get me started on the Fediverse (i.e. Mastodon) - which would be a whole talk in itself.

## Running an open source project with (almost) no community

I run the LibrePlan project. My biggest user is an oil company with offices in 30 countries. LibrePlan is a web-based project management application with very professional features. I have been managing this project for the past 5 years. In this talk I want to show you what LibrePlan is, why it’s so cool and how I kept the project alive. It is a talk about tech stuff, but also about moral dilemma’s. It’s a talk for newbies, but also for those with lots of open source development experience.

## Collecting badges with parkrun: The tale of the running-challenges browser extension

Last year, we added a new dimension of fun to Saturday morning 5k parkruns with virtual badges in a browser extension. Suddenly it became ‘a thing’ with 10,000 users across the world.

We’ll talk about how it all started, how and why we develop the extension for both Firefox and Chrome, our ethos, what data we have available and its limitations, and managing the requests and high expectations of the parkrun community.

Since starting parkrun in 2015, she's run on more than 140 Saturday mornings at more than 40 different parkrun locations in 5 different countries (nearest: Winchester; furthest: San Francisco). She has a p-index of 3.

## Lets map the world, Missing Maps and Openstreetmap

We all know Wikipedia, well there is a similar project for maps, OpenStreetMap. Currently most of the western nations have good coverage on both OpenStreetMap and other maps, but when we go to the poorer and underdeveloped parts of the world there are no maps. Not on detailed scale that is actually useful.

The Missing Maps project has set itself the target of getting the these parts of the world mapped.

And we in the west can directly help with this, by helping to create the base maps that local people then add to and correct. By creating open map data we are making the world accessible

In the talk I will show how you can directly help, and what open source technologies are doing to create the worlds open mapping resource.

## We built a crowd-sourced open data site!

Spoiler Alert - one day, you’re going to die. You may not get a blue plaque, but perhaps you’ll get a memorial bench. Liz & Terence have built openbenches.org where anyone can add to a collection of open data. We’ll show you why & how we built this collection of >12000 benches from around the world.
